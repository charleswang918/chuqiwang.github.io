I am a Master of Data Science student at the University of California, Irvine. My passion lies in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights, leveraging statistical and machine learning techniques to solve challenging problems. Before coming to UCI, I studied statistics and computer science at McGill University. Special thanks to Professors at UCI and McGill who have guided me in my academic journey.
