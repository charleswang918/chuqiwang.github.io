I am a Master of Data Science student at the University of California, Irvine. My passion lies in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights, leveraging statistical techniques to solve challenging problems. Before coming to UCI, I studied statistics at McGill University. Special thanks to Professors at UCI and McGill who have guided me in my academic journey.

Research Interest
======
My research interests broadly include statistical methods and applications, statistical modeling and data mining, causal inference, experimental design, biostatistics, and their applications in interdisciplinary research, especially in health-related problems, including mental health, environmental issues, food safety, and public health. Recently, I have been particularly motivated to explore personalized medicine for health monitoring and prevention through multimodal models.
