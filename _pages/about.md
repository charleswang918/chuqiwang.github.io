I am a Master of Data Science student at the University of California, Irvine. My passion lies in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights, leveraging statistical and machine learning techniques to solve challenging problems. Before coming to UCI, I studied statistics and computer science at McGill University. Special thanks to Professors at UCI and McGill who have guided me in my academic journey.

Research Interest
======
My research interests broadly include statistical methods and applications, machine learning and data mining, causal inference, deep learning, experimental design, biostatistics, and their applications in interdisciplinary research, especially in health-related problems, including mental health, environmental issues, food safety, and public health. Recently, I have been particularly motivated to explore personalized medicine by developing AI systems for health monitoring and prevention through multimodal models.
