I am a Master of Data Science student at the University of California, Irvine. My research interests broadly include statistical and machine learning, causal inference. Before coming to UCI, I studied statistics and computer science at McGill University. Special thanks to Professors at UCI and McGill who have guided me in my academic journey.
